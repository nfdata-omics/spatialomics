## Introduction

## Samplesheet input

You will need to create a samplesheet with information about the samples you would like to analyse before running the pipeline. Use this parameter to specify its location. It must be a comma-separated file with a header row. Each sample must provide either paired-end Visium sequencing reads in both `fastq_1` and `fastq_2`, or a pre-computed Space Ranger output directory in `spaceranger`.

```bash
--input '[path to samplesheet file]'
```

### Input use cases

The pipeline currently supports three main input use cases.

#### FASTQ files, microscopy image, and manual alignment

Provide `fastq_1`, `fastq_2`, the microscope H&E image in `image`, the instrument-generated CytAssist image in `cytaimage`, and `manual_alignment`. The pipeline runs `spaceranger count` and passes the JSON file in `manual_alignment` through the Space Ranger `--loupe-alignment` option. The spatial registration used by Space Ranger is therefore the one encoded in the supplied alignment file.

```csv title="samplesheet.csv"
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2,image,cytaimage,manual_alignment,slide,area
SAMPLE_A,SAMPLE_A_R1.fastq.gz,SAMPLE_A_R2.fastq.gz,SAMPLE_A_HE.tif,SAMPLE_A_CytAssist.tif,SAMPLE_A_alignment.json,V10A01-123,A1
```

#### FASTQ files and microscopy image without manual alignment

Provide `fastq_1`, `fastq_2`, the microscope H&E image in `image`, and the instrument-generated CytAssist image in `cytaimage`, leaving `manual_alignment` empty. The pipeline runs `spaceranger count` without `--loupe-alignment`, so Space Ranger performs its automatic registration of the microscope image to the CytAssist image and capture area.

```csv title="samplesheet.csv"
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2,image,cytaimage,manual_alignment,slide,area
SAMPLE_B,SAMPLE_B_R1.fastq.gz,SAMPLE_B_R2.fastq.gz,SAMPLE_B_HE.tif,SAMPLE_B_CytAssist.tif,,V10A01-456,B1
```

#### Pre-computed Space Ranger output and microscopy image

Provide the Space Ranger `outs` directory in `spaceranger` and the corresponding H&E image in `image`. The pipeline skips `spaceranger count` for that sample and starts from the downstream conversion and analysis steps.

```csv title="samplesheet.csv"
sample,spaceranger,image
SAMPLE_C,/path/to/SAMPLE_C/outs,/path/to/SAMPLE_C_HE.tif
```

> [!WARNING]
> In this use case, the pipeline assumes that the supplied image is already correctly registered to the spatial coordinates contained in the Space Ranger output. It does not establish or automatically verify this registration. The geometric overlap check and registration plots can reveal gross or visually apparent mismatches, but they do not prove that the image and coordinates belong to the same registered dataset.

### Optional microscopy image and image-dependent workflows

The FASTQ use cases documented here assume a CytAssist-enabled assay. The instrument-generated `cytaimage` is therefore required when the pipeline runs `spaceranger count`. The `image` column, which represents the separate microscope H&E image, is optional for Space Ranger and when starting from pre-computed Space Ranger output. For samples without this image, the pipeline automatically omits the image-dependent downstream processes by filtering those samples out of the corresponding input channel. Image-independent processing of the Space Ranger output and spatial count quality control can still run. This behavior is applied per sample: samples with an image can still run these steps in the same pipeline execution. Use `--skip_segmentation` to disable these image-dependent processes globally, including for samples that do provide an image.

For the CytAssist-enabled FASTQ inputs considered here, `cytaimage` is required. A separate microscope image in `image`, `darkimage`, or `colorizedimage` is optional for Space Ranger. When starting from pre-computed Space Ranger output, none of these images is needed to rerun `spaceranger count`, because that step is skipped. An `image` is only needed if the downstream image-dependent analyses are desired. `--skip_segmentation` controls those downstream analyses; it does not change Space Ranger's own input requirements.

### Multiple runs of the same sample

The `sample` identifiers have to be the same when you have re-sequenced the same sample more than once e.g. to increase sequencing depth. The pipeline will concatenate the raw reads before performing any downstream analysis. Below is an example for the same sample sequenced across 3 lanes:

```csv title="samplesheet.csv"
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2,image,cytaimage,slide,area
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz,CONTROL_REP1_HE.tif,CONTROL_REP1_CytAssist.tif,V10A01-123,A1
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L003_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L003_R2_001.fastq.gz,CONTROL_REP1_HE.tif,CONTROL_REP1_CytAssist.tif,V10A01-123,A1
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L004_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L004_R2_001.fastq.gz,CONTROL_REP1_HE.tif,CONTROL_REP1_CytAssist.tif,V10A01-123,A1
```

### Full samplesheet

FASTQ input must contain the paired R1 and R2 files produced for a Visium library. The supported columns are listed below. Columns that are not relevant to a particular input use case can be left empty or omitted.

An [example samplesheet](../assets/samplesheet.csv) covering the input use cases described above is provided with the pipeline.

## Running the pipeline

The typical command for running the pipeline is as follows:

```bash
nextflow run nfdata-omics/spatialomics --input ./samplesheet.csv --outdir ./results --genome GRCh37 -profile docker
```

This will launch the pipeline with the `docker` configuration profile. See below for more information about profiles.

Note that the pipeline will create the following files in your working directory:

```bash
work                # Directory containing the nextflow working files
<OUTDIR>            # Finished results in specified location (defined with --outdir)
.nextflow_log       # Log file from Nextflow
# Other nextflow hidden files, eg. history of pipeline runs and old logs.
```

If you wish to repeatedly use the same parameters for multiple runs, rather than specifying each flag in the command, you can specify these in a params file.

Pipeline settings can be provided in a `yaml` or `json` file via `-params-file <file>`.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not use `-c <file>` to specify parameters as this will result in errors. Custom config files specified with `-c` must only be used for [tuning process resource specifications](https://nf-co.re/docs/running/run-pipelines#configuring-pipelines), other infrastructural tweaks (such as output directories), or module arguments (args).

The above pipeline run specified with a params file in yaml format:

```bash
nextflow run nfdata-omics/spatialomics -profile docker -params-file params.yaml
```

with:

```yaml title="params.yaml"
input: './samplesheet.csv'
outdir: './results/'
genome: 'GRCh37'
<...>
```

You can also generate such `YAML`/`JSON` files via [nf-core/launch](https://nf-co.re/launch).

### Updating the pipeline

When you run the above command, Nextflow automatically pulls the pipeline code from GitHub and stores it as a cached version. When running the pipeline after this, it will always use the cached version if available - even if the pipeline has been updated since. To make sure that you're running the latest version of the pipeline, make sure that you regularly update the cached version of the pipeline:

```bash
nextflow pull nfdata-omics/spatialomics
```

### Reproducibility

It is a good idea to specify the pipeline version when running the pipeline on your data. This ensures that a specific version of the pipeline code and software are used when you run your pipeline. If you keep using the same tag, you'll be running the same version of the pipeline, even if there have been changes to the code since.

First, go to the [nfdata-omics/spatialomics releases page](https://github.com/nfdata-omics/spatialomics/releases) and find the latest pipeline version - numeric only (eg. `1.3.1`). Then specify this when running the pipeline with `-r` (one hyphen) - eg. `-r 1.3.1`. Of course, you can switch to another version by changing the number after the `-r` flag.

This version number will be logged in reports when you run the pipeline, so that you'll know what you used when you look back in the future. For example, at the bottom of the MultiQC reports.

To further assist in reproducibility, you can use share and reuse [parameter files](#running-the-pipeline) to repeat pipeline runs with the same settings without having to write out a command with every single parameter.

> [!TIP]
> If you wish to share such profile (such as upload as supplementary material for academic publications), make sure to NOT include cluster specific paths to files, nor institutional specific profiles.

## Core Nextflow arguments

> [!NOTE]
> These options are part of Nextflow and use a _single_ hyphen (pipeline parameters use a double-hyphen)

### `-profile`

Use this parameter to choose a configuration profile. Profiles can give configuration presets for different compute environments.

Several generic profiles are bundled with the pipeline which instruct the pipeline to use software packaged using different methods (Docker, Singularity, Podman, Shifter, Charliecloud, Apptainer, Conda) - see below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We highly recommend the use of Docker or Singularity containers for full pipeline reproducibility, however when this is not possible, Conda is also supported.

The pipeline also dynamically loads configurations from [https://github.com/nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs) when it runs, making multiple config profiles for various institutional clusters available at run time. For more information and to check if your system is supported, please see the [nf-core/configs documentation](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation).

Note that multiple profiles can be loaded, for example: `-profile test,docker` - the order of arguments is important!
They are loaded in sequence, so later profiles can overwrite earlier profiles.

If `-profile` is not specified, the pipeline will run locally and expect all software to be installed and available on the `PATH`. This is _not_ recommended, since it can lead to different results on different machines dependent on the computer environment.

- `test`
  - A profile with a complete configuration for automated testing
  - Includes links to test data so needs no other parameters
- `docker`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Docker](https://docker.com/)
- `singularity`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/docs/)
- `podman`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Podman](https://podman.io/)
- `shifter`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Shifter](https://nersc.gitlab.io/development/shifter/how-to-use/)
- `charliecloud`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Charliecloud](https://charliecloud.io/)
- `apptainer`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/)
- `wave`
  - A generic configuration profile to enable [Wave](https://seqera.io/wave/) containers. Use together with one of the above (requires Nextflow ` 24.03.0-edge` or later).
- `conda`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/). Please only use Conda as a last resort i.e. when it's not possible to run the pipeline with Docker, Singularity, Podman, Shifter, Charliecloud, or Apptainer.

### `-resume`

Specify this when restarting a pipeline. Nextflow will use cached results from any pipeline steps where the inputs are the same, continuing from where it got to previously. For input to be considered the same, not only the names must be identical but the files' contents as well. For more info about this parameter, see [this blog post](https://www.nextflow.io/blog/2019/demystifying-nextflow-resume.html).

You can also supply a run name to resume a specific run: `-resume [run-name]`. Use the `nextflow log` command to show previous run names.

### `-c`

Specify the path to a specific config file (this is a core Nextflow command). See the [nf-core website documentation](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration) for more information.

## Custom configuration

### Resource requests

Whilst the default requirements set within the pipeline will hopefully work for most people and with most input data, you may find that you want to customise the compute resources that the pipeline requests. Each step in the pipeline has a default set of requirements for number of CPUs, memory and time. For most of the pipeline steps, if the job exits with any of the error codes specified [here](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/blob/4c27ef5610c87db00c3c5a3eed10b1d161abf575/conf/base.config#L18) it will automatically be resubmitted with higher resources request (2 x original, then 3 x original). If it still fails after the third attempt then the pipeline execution is stopped.

To change the resource requests, please see the [max resources](https://nf-co.re/docs/running/configuration/nextflow-for-your-system#set-max-resources) and [customise process resources](https://nf-co.re/docs/running/configuration/nextflow-for-your-system#customize-process-resources) section of the nf-core website.

### Custom Containers

In some cases, you may wish to change the container or conda environment used by a pipeline steps for a particular tool. By default, nf-core pipelines use containers and software from the [biocontainers](https://biocontainers.pro/) or [bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) projects. However, in some cases the pipeline specified version maybe out of date.

To use a different container from the default container or conda environment specified in a pipeline, please see the [updating tool versions](https://nf-co.re/docs/running/configuration/nextflow-for-your-system#update-tool-versions) section of the nf-core website.

### Custom Tool Arguments

A pipeline might not always support every possible argument or option of a particular tool used in pipeline. Fortunately, nf-core pipelines provide some freedom to users to insert additional parameters that the pipeline does not include by default.

To learn how to provide additional arguments to a particular tool of the pipeline, please see the [customising tool arguments](https://nf-co.re/docs/running/configuration/nextflow-for-your-system#modifying-tool-arguments) section of the nf-core website.

### nf-core/configs

In most cases, you will only need to create a custom config as a one-off but if you and others within your organisation are likely to be running nf-core pipelines regularly and need to use the same settings regularly it may be a good idea to request that your custom config file is uploaded to the `nf-core/configs` git repository. Before you do this please can you test that the config file works with your pipeline of choice using the `-c` parameter. You can then create a pull request to the `nf-core/configs` repository with the addition of your config file, associated documentation file (see examples in [`nf-core/configs/docs`](https://github.com/nf-core/configs/tree/master/docs)), and amending [`nfcore_custom.config`](https://github.com/nf-core/configs/blob/master/nfcore_custom.config) to include your custom profile.

See the main [Nextflow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html) for more information about creating your own configuration files.

If you have any questions or issues please send us a message on [Slack](https://nf-co.re/join/slack) on the [`#configs` channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/configs).

## Running in the background

Nextflow handles job submissions and supervises the running jobs. The Nextflow process must run until the pipeline is finished.

The Nextflow `-bg` flag launches Nextflow in the background, detached from your terminal so that the workflow does not stop if you log out of your session. The logs are saved to a file.

Alternatively, you can use `screen` / `tmux` or similar tool to create a detached session which you can log back into at a later time.
Some HPC setups also allow you to run nextflow within a cluster job submitted your job scheduler (from where it submits more jobs).

## Nextflow memory requirements

In some cases, the Nextflow Java virtual machines can start to request a large amount of memory.
We recommend adding the following line to your environment to limit this (typically in `~/.bashrc` or `~./bash_profile`):

```bash
NXF_OPTS='-Xms1g -Xmx4g'
```
